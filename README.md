Deploying a MediaWiki application with MySQL to an Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster involves several steps, including creating the necessary Kubernetes manifests, setting up Azure services, and configuring MediaWiki. Here's a general outline of the process:

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Azure subscription and resource group.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster created.
Azure CLI and kubectl installed.
Helm installed on your local machine.
Create Kubernetes Manifests:
You'll need to create Kubernetes manifests for MediaWiki and MySQL. This typically involves writing YAML files for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. Here's a simplified example:

Create a mediawiki-deployment.yaml for MediaWiki.
Create a mysql-deployment.yaml for MySQL.
Create a Service for each deployment.
Deploy MySQL:
Deploy MySQL to your AKS cluster using kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml. Ensure you use a PersistentVolume or Azure Disk to store the MySQL data.

Deploy MediaWiki:
Deploy MediaWiki to the AKS cluster using kubectl apply -f mediawiki-deployment.yaml. Make sure you configure the environment variables and volume mounts for MediaWiki to connect to the MySQL database.

Azure Database for MySQL (Optional):
Instead of running MySQL within the AKS cluster, you can consider using Azure Database for MySQL, a managed service for MySQL. In this case, MediaWiki should be configured to connect to the Azure Database for MySQL.

Ingress Controller:
Set up an Ingress Controller like Nginx Ingress or Azure Application Gateway to route external traffic to your MediaWiki application.

DNS Configuration:
Configure DNS settings to point your domain to the IP address or hostname associated with the Ingress Controller.

Azure Load Balancer (Optional):
If you are using an Ingress Controller, you may need to set up an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your AKS cluster.

Security and Network Policies:
Implement security best practices like Network Policies, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and secure secrets management.

Monitoring and Logging:
Set up monitoring and logging solutions like Azure Monitor, Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack to keep track of your application's performance.

Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for your MySQL data and application.

Scaling and Auto-Scaling:
Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling and cluster scaling as needed based on the application's demand.

Secrets Management:
Store sensitive information like database credentials in Kubernetes Secrets or a key vault.

Testing and Validation:
Thoroughly test your deployment to ensure that MediaWiki is functioning as expected.

Maintenance and Updates:
Regularly update your application and Kubernetes cluster, and apply security patches.

Documentation:
1. To deploy a MediaWiki application using Helm, you can create a Helm chart that defines the Kubernetes resources and configurations needed to run MediaWiki. Helm simplifies the deployment process by allowing you to define, package, and manage your Kubernetes application as a chart. Here are the steps to achieve this:


Create a Helm Chart:

You can create a Helm chart for deploying MediaWiki by running the following Helm command:

helm create mediawiki
This command will create a new Helm chart named "mediawiki."

Configure the Helm Chart:

Inside the mediawiki chart directory, you'll find various subdirectories and files. You need to configure the chart to deploy MediaWiki. Below is a simplified example of how to configure the chart. You may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements.

Chart.yaml: Update the metadata in the Chart.yaml file, specifying the chart name and version.

values.yaml: Customize values in the values.yaml file. For example, set the database username, password, and other MediaWiki-related settings.

templates/deployment.yaml: Create a Deployment resource for MediaWiki and define the necessary environment variables, volumes, and containers.

templates/service.yaml: Create a Service resource for accessing MediaWiki.

templates/pvc.yaml: Define a PersistentVolumeClaim if you want to use persistent storage.


Install the Helm Chart:

To install the Helm chart, run the following command in the chart's directory:

helm install my-mediawiki-release ./mediawiki
Replace my-mediawiki-release with your desired release name.

Access MediaWiki:

After the deployment is complete, you can access MediaWiki by forwarding the service's port to your local machine using kubectl port-forward. For example:

kubectl port-forward service/my-mediawiki-release-mediawiki 8080:80
You can then access MediaWiki in your web browser by visiting http://localhost:8080.

This is a simplified example of how to deploy MediaWiki using Helm. Depending on your specific requirements and infrastructure, you may need to customize the Helm chart further. Additionally, consider configuring persistent storage for your database and implementing other necessary configurations for a production-grade deployment.
